        <p>Today, I found a Pokemon Game. It's seems like a copy of Project Pokemon? I honestly don't know. I am still glad though. I miss playing Pokemon games in Roblox. By the way, The name of the game is Amethyst.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I closed this website for construction few hours ago. After I reopned the website, I realised that my blog section is forbidden for my browser. So I thought the file had some minor mistskes with the code. I checked for bugs, there was no bugs found in the code... And then I made the website in construction again... After fixing everything I could, I reopened the website again. And it was still forbidden. And finally, the last solution. I had to use a different browser to load the website. I used Opera GX Browser to check if it was still forbidden. And guess what? It was NOT forbidden. I was relieved. I thought I have to shut down the website once again! I might have to end it here...</p>

        <p>Edit: I found out that I encrypted the CSS folder so thats why...</p>
